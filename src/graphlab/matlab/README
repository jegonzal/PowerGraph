============== Introduction ==================

The goal is to simplify the process of GraphLab rapid propotyping by
allow the user to write update functions in Matlab while still providing
good parallel performance. The problem however, is that Matlab is not
thread-safe, and providing a GraphLab->Matlab interface by simply using Mex will
not offer any performance gains through the use of parallelism. 

To solve this problem, we provide the Matlab to GraphLab compiler.
The Matlab to GraphLab compiler is a toolkit which uses Matlab 2010b's EMLC
compiler to translate update functions written in Matlab to native C code.
The C code is then compiled into a GraphLab program. Additional interface
functions are also provided which allow the user to interact with the GraphLab
program from Matlab. The only caveat is that update functions must be written
in Embedded Matlab: a subset of the full Matlab language.

Unfortunately not all of GraphLab is fully supported yet. We will continue
making improvements available as we implement them.

============== System Requirements ==============

  - A *nix environment.
  - MATLAB 2010b or later
  - g++ 4.3 or earlier (for MATLAB 2010b)
  - make
  - A build/installation of GraphLab

============== Embedded Matlab ==================
Embedded Matlab is a subset of the full Matlab language. In particular, it
does not support

 - Cell arrays
 - Java
 - Matrix deletion
 - Nested functions
 - Objects
 - Sparse matrices
 - try/catch statements
 - Recursion
 - 64 bit integers

(Source: http://www.mathworks.com/help/toolbox/eml/ug/bq37agh.html#bq37dee)

It also supports only a subset of Matlab functions.
(http://www.mathworks.com/help/toolbox/eml/ug/bq1h2z7-9.html)


In addition, the Matlab to GraphLab Compiler does not yet support

 - logical arrays
 - character matrices. (strings are supported)
 - complex numbers

------------ Typing -----------------
Embedded Matlab can be thought of as a "strongly typed" version of Matlab.
The type of the variables cannot depend on the program flow.

For instance: the following code is not allowed:

    % Source: http://www.mathworks.com/help/toolbox/eml/ug/bq2l74g.html
    if(c>0)
      x = int8(0);
    else
      x = [1 2 3];
    end
    disp(x);

Since the type of x depends on the value of c.

However, the following is allowed:

    x = int8(0);
    x = [1 2 3];

In this case: the EMLC compiler will rename the second instance of x.
See http://www.mathworks.com/help/toolbox/eml/ug/bq2l74g.html for more
details on the use of variables in Embedded Matlab.


================= Matlab To GraphLab =================
--------------- Graph Representation ---------------
The data graph is defined over two data types. A vertex data type, and an
edge data type. In MatLab, this means that all vertices must be of the
same data type, and all edges must be of a same (possibly different) data type.

For instance, if one vertex data is a double matrix, all vertex data  must be
double matrices. And if one edge data has a particular struct layout, All edge
data must follow the identical struct layout.

For instance: if I were to define a pairwise Markov Random Field for
Belief Propagation, I could define my vertex and edge data to be:

  vdata.belief : 1 x N matrix
  vdata.unary : 1 x N matrix

  edata.msg : 1 x N matrix
  edata.binary: N x N matrix

For users familar with EMLC, you might know that EMLC defines arrays of
different sizes to be different types. To simplify the use of the Matlab to
GraphLab, the compiler automatically forces all array types to be variable
sizes. Therefore the effective data type is

  vdata.belief : 1 x :? matrix
  vdata.unary : 1 x :? matrix

  edata.msg : 1 x :? matrix
  edata.binary: :? x :? matrix

Where each ":?" can be a different value for each vertex/edge, and can change
at runtime.

The canonical representation we will use for the graph representation is the
triplet (VDATA, ADJ, EDATA). 

VDATA: is a cell array of vertex data where VDATA{i} is the data on vertex i.
       The length of this cell array is the number of vertices in the graph.

ADJ :  A (sparse) adjacency matrix. If ADJ(i,j) > 0, there is an edge from
       vertex i to vertex j, and the data on the edge i->j is EDATA{ADJ(i,j)}
       The maximum dimensions of ADJ is #vertices * #vertices.

EDATA: A cell array of edge data. The ADJ adjacency matrix references into
       this array. It is possible for many edges to share the same data element.
       For instance, if I have many edges with the same value, it is possible
       for all their ADJ entries to point to a single entry in EDATA.

--------------- Update Functions ---------------
An update function must satisfy the following interface:

    function bp_update(currentvertex, inedges, inv, outedges, outv, handle)%#eml

  currentvertex: an integer ID of the vertex currently being evaluated
  
  inedges: An array of integers identifying the set of edges entering the
           current vertex.
           
  inv: An array of integers of the same length as inedges. inv[i] is the
       vertex ID of the source of the edge inedges[i].
       
  outedges: An array of integers identifying the set of edges leaving the
           current vertex.
           
  outv: An array of integers of the same length as outedges. outv[i] is the
        vertex ID of the source of the edge outedges[i].

  handle: A double value. Do not modify. This should be passed directly
          to the "link" functions

A useful property to note is that both inv and outv are sorted arrays.
Therefore, if the entire graph is bi-directed, (i.e. inv == outv),
then necessarily inedges[i] is the corresponding reverse edge for outedges[i].


In addition: the following functions are provided which allow the update
functions access to the graph data and the scheduler. This family of functions
are called "link" functions. (they allow the EML code to call GraphLab code)
The handle parameter must be passed unmodified to these functions:

The following four functions provide access to vertex data and edge data.

    function vdata = get_vertex_data(handle, vertex)  % returns data on vertex
    function edata = get_edge_data(handle, edge)  % returns data on edge
    function set_vertex_data(handle, vertex, vdata)  % sets data on vertex
    function set_edge_data(handle, edge, edata)  % sets data on edge

In addition, we provde an 'add_task' function which allows for
dynamic scheduling.

    function add_task(handle, vertex, 'function name', priority)

--------------- Compilation ---------------

Whenever the vertex data type / edge data type / or the update function
changes, it is necessary to recompile the code.

The function compile_update_function in the graphlab/matlab directory
is used to compile the code. (Do not move the compile_update_function.m file
from that location! It uses its location to identify the directory for the
GraphLab header files)

 compile_update_function    Compiles a collection of update functions into
                            a graphlab program.

   compile_update_function(UPDATE_FNS, EX_VERTEX, EX_EDGE,
                           GLLIB_DIR, WORKING_DIR, OUT_NAME,
                           OPT_LEVEL = 0, PAR_COMPILES = 4,
                           NO_TCMALLOC = 0);

   This function is the wrapper around the Matlab -> GraphLab compilation
   process. It will use emlc to compile a collection of update function
   names as listed as strings in UPDATE_FNS into binary executables in
   the WORKING_DIR.



 Input:

   UPDATE_FNS: is a cell array of strings, where each string is the name
               of a GraphLab update function to compile.
               (see above for details on the update functions)

   EX_VERTEX: This should be representative example of the data on
              a vertex.

   EX_EDGE  : This should be representative example of the data on
              a edge.

   GLLIB_DIR: This should point to a directory where the GraphLab binary
              libraries can be found. For instance, this could be
              empty if all graphlab libraries are already in /usr/lib.
              Or if you compiled GraphLab without installing it,
              this could point to the release/src/graphlab directory.

   WORKING_DIR:  All intermediate source files and Makefiles will be
                 stored in this directory. The resultant binaries will
                 also be stored here. This directory will be created
                 if it does not already exist

   OUT_NAME:  This is the base name to use for the final compiled
              binaries/m files.

   OPT_LEVEL:  Optimization level. corresponds to the -O[N] flag in 'gcc'.
               Defaults to 0.

   PAR_COMPILES:  This function will automatically begin building the
                  Makefiles. This is the parallelization level for the
                  build and corresponds to -j[N] flag in 'make'.
                  Defaults to 4.

   NO_TCMALLOC:  This function will try to detect the existance of
                 libtcmalloc through the use of 'whereis'. If detected,
                 it will automatically try to link the binaries against
                 libtcmalloc. If this flag is set to non-zero, we will
                 never link against tcmalloc even if detected.
                 Defaults to false.



 Output:

   The script will poroduce a Makefile in the WORKING_DIR which will
   compile the following 3 binaries (OUT_NAME)_save_graph,
   (OUT_NAME)_binary and (OUT_NAME)_load_graph.





   (OUT_NAME)_save_graph is a mex library

            (OUT_NAME)_save_graph(VDATA, ADJ, EDATA, ...
                                       OPTIONS, GRAPHFILE, STRICT)

   This function will serialize the graph described by VDATA, ADJ, EDATA
   as well as OPTIONS.initial_schedule to the file GRAPHFILE. If STRICT
   is set stricter type checking will be used.

      VDATA: is a cell array of vertex data where VDATA{i} is the data on
             vertex i. The length of this cell array is the number of
             vertices in the graph.

      ADJ :  A (sparse) adjacency matrix. If ADJ(i,j) > 0, there is an
             edge from vertex i to vertex j, where the data on the edge
             i->j is EDATA{ADJ(i,j)} The maximum dimensions of ADJ is
             #vertices * #vertices.

      EDATA: A cell array of edge data. The ADJ adjacency matrix
             references into this array. It is possible for many edges to
             share the same data element. For instance, if I have many
             edges with the same value, it is possible for all their ADJ
             entries to point to a single entry in EDATA.

      OPTIONS: A struct of only one field "initial_schedule".
               (leaving room for future extensions)

         OPTIONS.initial_schedule = [SCHED1, SCHED2 ...]
                 A struct array describing the initial schedule where each
                 sched entry has the following format:

         SCHED.update_function : A string. The name of the update function
         SCHED.vertices        : array of vertex ids to update
         SCHED.priority        : same size as vertices. The priority for
                               each update. Must be >0

         For instance, if I have two update functions 'u1' and 'u2'
         and I would like u1 to update vertices 1:100 with high priority,
         and u2 to update vertices 101:200 with lower priority.
         I could fill in the OPTIONS:

             OPTIONS.initial_schedule(1).update_function = 'u1'
             OPTIONS.initial_schedule(1).vertices = 1:100
             OPTIONS.initial_schedule(1).priority = ones(1,100);

             OPTIONS.initial_schedule(2).update_function = 'u2'
             OPTIONS.initial_schedule(2).vertices = 101:200
             OPTIONS.initial_schedule(2).priority = 0.1 * ones(1,100);

      GRAPHFILE: the file to output to.

      STRICT: numeric. Whether strict type checking will be used.






   (OUT_NAME)_binary is a standalone program

   This program takes in the standard GraphLab command line options,
   (run (OUT_NAME)_binary --help for details), as well two additional
   options.

      --ingraphfile=[INGRAPH] --outgraphfile=[OUTGRAPH]

   INGRAPH will read the GRAPHFILE generated by (OUTPUT_M_NAME)_save_graph
   and run GraphLab on it, using the parameters specified on the command
   line, as well as the initial schedule passed into the OPTIONS parameter
   of (OUTPUT_M_NAME)_save_graph. When complete the result will be stored
   in OUTGRAPH which can be read be (OUTPUT_M_NAME)_load_graph.






   (OUT_NAME)_load_graph is a mex library

            [VDATA, ADJ, EDATA] = (OUT_NAME)_load_graph(GRAPHFILE)

   This function will deserialize the graph in GRAPHFILE and return the
   result in VDATA, ADJ, EDATA. See the documentation for
   (OUT_NAME)_load_graph for the format of VDATA, ADJ, EDATA.





   Finally we also output a matlab script with the name OUT_NAME.m.

   This is an M file generated in the working directory which automates
   the calling of save_graph, the binary and the load_graph functions.

   The interface is:
           [NEWVDATA, NEWADJ, NEWEDATA] = OUT_NAME(VDATA, ADJ, EDATA, ...
                                                   OPTIONS, STRICT)

      [VDATA, ADJ, EDATA]: graph representation. See
                           (OUT_NAME)_save_graph above for details

      OPTIONS: A struct denoting the GraphLab parameters and the initial
               schedule.

      OPTIONS.initial_schedule: (OUT_NAME)_save_graph above for details

      OPTIONS.ncpus: A positive numeric denoting #threads to start.

      OPTIONS.scheduler: A string describing the scheduler and the
                         scheduler parameters. Identical to the
                         --scheduler=... parameter when running a
                         GraphLab program.
                         Run (OUT_NAME)_binary --help for details

      OPTIONS.scope: A string describing the scope type. Should be
                     either 'edge', 'vertex' or 'full'. Identical to the
                         --scope=... parameter when running a
                         GraphLab program.

   The script first calls (OUT_NAME)_save_graph with the arguments VDATA,
   ADJ, EDATA, OPTIONS.initial_schedule and STRUCT. The graph file name
   GRAPHFILE is automatically generated. The current directory must be
   writeable.  Next, it will invoke the program (OUT_NAME)_binary
   passing it the rest of the parameters in OPTIONS. Finally the output
   of the binary is read back using (OUT_NAME)_load_graph and returned.


==================== Limitations ===========================

1) Type limitations: The Matlab to GraphLab compiler oes not yet support

 - logical arrays
 - character matrices. (strings are supported)
 - complex numbers

2) Pseudo-Random numbers: 

EMLC does provide random number generation through the family of rand()
functions. However, they are not built to be thread-safe, so use at
your own risk. Later improvements to the GraphLab to Matlab compiler
will provide alternate substitutes for rand() which are thread safe.
Even so, many typical Matlab functions should work with minimal modifications.

3) GraphLab's Shared Data Table and Sync Operation

Future versions of the Matlab to GraphLab compiler may provide this.
This is low priority at the moment.

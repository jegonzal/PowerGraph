"Synchronous Engine (sync)\n"
"=========================\n"
"The synchronous engine executes all active vertex program\n"
"synchronously in a sequence of super-step (iterations) in both the\n"
"shared and distributed memory settings.\n"
"\n"
"max_iterations: (default: infinity) The maximum number\n"
"of iterations (super-steps) to run.\n"
"\n"
"timeout: (default: infinity) The maximum time in\n"
"seconds that the engine may run. When the time runs out the\n"
"current iteration is completed and then the engine terminates.\n"
"\n"
"use_cache: (default: false) This is used to enable\n"
"caching. The update function must be written in a specific way\n"
"to take advantage of this. See the documentation for details.\n"
"\n"
"snapshot_interval: (default: -1) If set to a positive value, a snapshot\n"
"is taken every this number of iterations. If set to 0, a snapshot\n"
"is taken before the first iteration. If set to a negative value,\n"
"no snapshots are taken. A snapshot is a binary dump of the graph.\n"
"\n"
"snapshot_path: If snapshot_interval is set to a value >=0,\n"
"this option must be specified and should contain a target basename \n"
"for the snapshot. The path including folder and file prefix in \n"
"which the snapshots should be saved.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Asynchronous Engine (async)\n"
"===========================\n"
"The asynchronous consistent engine executed vertex programs\n"
"asynchronously but ensures mutual exclusion such that adjacent vertices\n"
" \n"
"max_clean_fraction (default: 1) \n"
"The maximum proportion of edges which can be locked at any one time.\n"
"\n"
"timeout (default: infinity) Maximum time in seconds the engine will\n"
"run for. \n"
"\n"
"factorized (default: false) Set to true to weaken the consistency\n"
"model to factorized consistency where only individual gather/apply/scatter\n"
"calls are guaranteed to be locally consistent. Can produce large \n"
"increases in throughput at a consistency penalty.\n"
"\n"
"use_cache: (default: false) This is used to enable\n"
"caching. The update function must be written in a specific way\n"
"to take advantage of this. See the documentation for details.\n"
